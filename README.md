# JavaScript-Snake
This is a classis snake game. You play as Snaik, a snake that loves apples (the red cubes). If you eat them, you become longer. The more apples you eat, the faster your snake will move.
NOTE: When you are starting off, don't click two buttons consecutively very fast. This will make your snake die and you will lose. Doing this is only possible when you have reached a certain length.
